# Configuration file for /sbin/dhclient, which is included in Debian's
#	dhcp3-client package.
#
# This is a sample configuration file for dhclient. See dhclient.conf's
#	man page for more information about the syntax of this file
#	and a more comprehensive list of the parameters understood by
#	dhclient.
#
# Normally, if the DHCP server provides reasonable information and does
#	not leave anything out (like the domain name, for example), then
#	few changes must be made to this file, if any.

# Code below here illustrates an example on how to get different setups with different host names
# on each interface. Unfortunately, this configuraiton doesn't match the ifplugd configuration, and
# thus it had to be removed. So, only one host name exists for each device.

#send host-name "Cross_eth0";
#request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
#	domain-name, domain-name-servers,
#	netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu, ntp-servers;
#}

#interface "eth1" {
#send host-name "Cross_eth1";
#request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
#	domain-name, domain-name-servers,
#	netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu;
